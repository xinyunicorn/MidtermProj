        I'm not really much of a baker, and most of my previous attempts at baking have ended in failure. So, I was very surprised to find out my brownies were successful! My sister and I decided to make brownies out of Nutella after learning that our jar of Nutella was about to expire :(. Don't waste your Nutella - let's make some brownies!!

      <div class="text">
        <ul>
          <li>¬æ cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>2 eggs</li>
          <li>‚Öì cup softened (not melted), unsalted butter</li>
          <li>¬Ω cup light brown sugar</li>
          <li>¬Ω tsp salt</li>
          <li>2 tsp vanilla extract (or honey as a substitute!)</li>
          <li>1 cup Nutella</li>

        </ul>

      <div>Instructions:</div> 
      <div class="text">
        <ol>
          <li>Sift the flour through a strainer to prevent clumps. Set this aside for now.</li>
          <li>Leave the butter to soften to room temperature <span class="blue">(do not rush the process by putting it in the microwave!!)</span> before placing it into a large bowl and using a spatula or mixer to smooth it out.</li>
          <li>Add the brown sugar into the bowl and continue mixing. Use a spatula to scrape the sides of the bowl as needed. <span class="blue">Note: using a mixer will make the next few steps more efficient but if you don‚Äôt have one, using a whisk works as well (it will just take a bit longer).</span></li>
          <li>Add in the eggs and either the vanilla extract or honey into the bowl while mixing. Again, scraping the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
          <li>Once everything is well-combined, add in the Nutella and salt into the mixture also while mixing. And you should know the drill by now - scrape the sides of the bowl as needed.</li>
          <li>Now it‚Äôs time to add in the flour. While mixing, slowly add in the flour little at a time. After all the flour is added in, keep mixing until the mixture is smooth like cake batter. <span class="red">Warning: don‚Äôt overmix!! Otherwise the mixture will become too watery.</span></li>
          <li>Preheat your oven to <span class="red">350 degrees Fahrenheit</span> while we prep the pan.</li>
          <li>Take an 8-in square baking pan and line it with either parchment paper or aluminum foil.</li>
          <li>Pour the batter into the pan and tap the bottom of the pan against a flat surface a few times to get rid of air bubbles.</li>
          <li>Place the pan into the oven with proper protection/equipment (ie. oven mitts).</li>
          <li>Bake the brownies for around 30 minutes. Check if they‚Äôre done by sticking a toothpick in it - if the toothpick has batter stuck to it, it needs to bake a bit longer. Make sure to check every few minutes so that your brownies don‚Äôt burn.</li>
          <li>Carefully take out the pan with the same amount of caution as before (if not more!) and let it sit for a few minutes to cool down.</li>
          <li>Once cooled down, you can remove the entire brownie from the pan. Slice the brownie into pieces (or not) and share with others (or not). Serve with some ice cream or have it as a snack. Enjoy! :P</li>
