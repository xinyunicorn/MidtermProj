          This recipe isn't really a recipe at all because I learned how to make this dish just by watching my mom make it. Still, I LOVEE soup noodles so I'm going to try my best to describe the process of me making a bowl. Also, you can very much tell the pictures below are not mine because I just love these noodle so much that I would rather eat them right away than take a picture :D.

      <div>Instructions:</div> 
      <div class="text">
        <ol>
          <li><span class="blue">Note: this recipe is mainly eyeballing the measurements. Adjust the amount of flavors however you like!</span></li>
          <li>Soak the vermicelli noodles in a bowl of water, making sure the noodles are submerged in the water. Set this aside for now.</li>
          <li>Take a pot large enough to hold everything you‚Äôre going to add. We‚Äôre going to cook everything in this pot to save ourselves some dishes to wash :D.</li>
          <li>Add some vegetable oil into the pot. Allow the oil to warm up a bit on <span class="red">MEDIUM</span> heat. It‚Äôs ready if you hover your hand over the pot and can feel the heat.</li>
          <li>Crack the egg into the pot and let it fry. Add some salt and pepper to season it.</li>
          <li>After a while, flip the egg to cook the other side. Again, add some seasoning.</li>
          <li>Now you have yourself a fried egg! Take it out of the pot and set this aside for now.</li>
          <li>Chop up the green onions and garlic. Add a little more oil to the pot and again, allow it to warm up on <span class="red">MEDIUM</span> heat.</li>
          <li>Add the green onions and garlic to the pot and stir them around. You should already smell some of the aroma.</li>
          <li>Now add in any of the vegetables or other toppings you would like in your soup. I like to add in some bok choy and scallops. Mix all these ingredients together.</li>
          <li>Time to make the soup! Leave everything in your pot and just add in enough water to fill about half your pot. Place the pot‚Äôs lid on top and wait for the soup to boil.</li>
          <li>Once boiling, add the vermicelli noodles you set aside earlier and give it a good mix.</li>
          <li>For the spices, it will depend on how much water you added to your pot. But now is the time to add in the chicken bouillon, cooking wine, and salt. Add in little by little and give your soup a taste test with each adjustment. <span class="red">Careful it‚Äôs hot!</span></li>
          <li>Serve your noodle soup in a large bowl or you can even just eat straight out of the pot! Add your fried egg from earlier on top and I like to drizzle some sesame oil. Enjoy! :P</li>
