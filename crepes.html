        This crepes recipe is simple and sweet (no pun intended) - it's basically just making really thin pancakes. The most difficult part is probably not eating them all at once (which my brother learned the hard way not to do). With these crepes, you can choose to make them sweet or savory and add whatever topping you'd like in the end :). I don't want to keep you from your crepes any longer so without further ado, let's begin!

        <ul>
          <li>1 cup all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>2 eggs</li>
          <li>2 tbsp melted, unsalted butter</li>
          <li>1 Â¼ cup milk</li>
          <li>Â¼ tsp salt</li>

        <ol>
          <li>Sift the flour through a strainer to prevent clumps.</li>
          <li>Add the flour and eggs into a large bowl and begin mixing.</li>
          <li>While mixing, slowly start pouring in your milk. Pour in a little milk, mix a bit, then pour in a little more milk, mix a bit - repeat this process until youâ€™ve poured in all your milk. Donâ€™t pour it all in at once!</li>
          <li>Add the butter and salt and continue mixing. If youâ€™re planning to make a dessert crepe, now is the time to add in the sugar and either the vanilla extract or honey. Once the batter is smooth, you know itâ€™s ready to cook.</li>
          <li>Take a non-stick pan and thinly coat it with a little bit of butter using a paper towel. Allow the pan to warm up on the stove on <span class="red">MEDIUM</span> heat.</li>
          <li>Once the pan is warmed up, scoop about Â¼ cup from your batter and pour into the middle of the pan. Slowly tilt your pan in a circular motion to coat the pan evenly.</li>
          <li>Allow the crepe to cook until the top of the crepe is no longer batter. Use a spatula to carefully run along the edge of the crepe to prepare to flip.</li>
          <li>Flip the crepe and allow the other side to cook. Once both sides are golden brown, the crepe is ready to serve.</li>
          <li>Fill the crepe with whatever you would like! If youâ€™re making a savory crepe, you can add some grilled chicken, lettuce, and teriyaki sauce. If youâ€™re making a dessert crepe, you can add some Nutella, strawberries, and bananas. Enjoy! :P</li>
